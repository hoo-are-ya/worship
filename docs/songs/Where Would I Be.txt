Where Would I Be


Verse 1
Your hand in every part
Of my whole life from the start
Jesus You have always been with me
No matter where I was
You found a way to show up
Jesus You have always been with me


Pre-Chorus
There's never a season never a place
Where I am alone where You don't show Your face
Right here I remember how could I forget
Your faithfulness has never left me


Chorus
Where would I be without You
Where would I be without Your love
I'm amazed by all You've done
Oh Jesus where would I be without You
Where would I be without Your love
I can't say thank You enough


Verse 2
All of the ways You save
Pull me out of the grave
Jesus You have always been for me
Oh my life is the proof
That You can make anything good
Jesus You have always been for me
